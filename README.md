Machine Learning Project to predict the Credit Approval Flags. 
During this project in the banking sector, I engaged in a comprehensive Machine Learning initiative aimed at predicting Credit Approval Flags. This endeavor was designed to streamline the credit approval process by leveraging predictive modeling techniques. Our primary objective was to assign approval flags, denoted as P1, P2, P3, etc., to customers based on their priority levels.

To achieve this, we employed two distinct datasets: CIBIL data and customer information. The CIBIL dataset provided crucial insights into individuals' credit histories, while the customer information dataset furnished additional contextual details. Combining these datasets yielded a comprehensive dataset comprising 88 columns.

An intriguing aspect of this project was the opportunity to delve into various statistical methodologies commonly utilized in the banking domain. Techniques such as chi-square tests, t-tests, and Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) were instrumental in extracting actionable insights from the data.

Furthermore, I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with Spyder IDE, a tool tailored for scientific computing and data analysis. Although initially daunting, working with Spyder proved to be a rewarding experience, enhancing my proficiency in handling large-scale datasets efficiently.

One of the notable challenges encountered during this project was dealing with missing data. While the datasets did not explicitly contain null values, entries represented as '-99999' were deemed equivalent to null. Addressing this required implementing conditional checks and treating such entries appropriately to ensure data integrity and model accuracy.

Overall, this project not only provided valuable insights into the intricacies of the banking domain but also honed my skills in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling within a real-world context.
